# Frequent-Scams
This is a list of frequent scams we find in discord channels and DMs. Please feel free to update this list with any new scams you may have encountered. But before you do so, please check if the scam you want to add already exists in the list.
#### It is up to us to keep the internet safe 

Special note to bot developers:
